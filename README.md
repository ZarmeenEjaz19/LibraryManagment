# LibraryManagment
A simple yet powerful Library Management System built using Python’s GUI toolkits: tkinter and PyQt. This app allows you to manage physical and digital books — add, lend, return, and remove books easily, with user-friendly interfaces available in both frameworks.

🚀 Features
📖 Add Books: Add physical or digital books with details like title, author, ISBN, and size for eBooks.
📤 Lend Books: Lend books to users — ensures a book cannot be lent twice.
📥 Return Books: Return previously lent books by title.
❌ Remove Books: Remove unwanted books from the library.
🧑‍💼 Search by Author: Find all books available by a specific author.
✅ Digital Library Support: Special handling for eBooks, including file size input.
🧠 OOP Design: Built with clean, extensible object-oriented Python code.
🖥️ Two UI Options: Available with both Tkinter and PyQt GUI versions.
🖼️ Interface Preview
The GUI features input fields for book data, checkboxes for eBook options, and buttons for all key actions — all managed through an intuitive layout.
